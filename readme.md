# About

FFMediaCacheGrabber is intended to be a general media cache grabber for Firefox. This initial release only supports MP3 files obtained from Google Translate's Speech function. In the future it should support flv, mp4, and other mp3 files other than Google Translate Speech MP3 files.

# Code style

This initial release contains pretty raw and unrefined code so that I could just get it working. Now that it's working, the code should get better and I will remove this message once I think it's better.

# Release

There is a precompiled binary and how-to instructions already ready on my website here.
